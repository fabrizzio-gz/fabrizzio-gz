### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I graduated in environmental engineering. Realizing that I had enjoyed programming the most during my studies, I decided to switch careers. For the last few years I've enjoyed the process of learning more and more about programming.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about testing React web components.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a website to visualize and record events on a map.
